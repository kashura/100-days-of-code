# 100 Days Of Learning - Log

### Day 01: September 16, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Focused on C173. Working through the fundamentals. 
Watched almost 2 hours of pluralsight Security+ course prep.
Set up Kali VM to start getting used to the environment.

**Thoughts:** Fundamentals course is very boring and it doesn't feel very hands on. I do need to power through without and get out of the dopamine highs and power through dull subjects.

**Link to work:** N/A
